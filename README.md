## WebScraper Using Java 
This repository contains a Java-based web scraper that uses JavaScript and HTML to build a user interface where the user can input a URL, and the scraper extracts all the links on the page and stores the results in a CSV file on the local system.

## Why Java?
Although Python is preferred for building web scrapers, Java may have advantages in terms of performance, scalability, robustness, and available libraries, depending on specific project requirements and familiarity with the language.
Java is a popular language for web scraping because it is efficient and has a wide range of libraries and tools available and it comes with a library known as `Jsoup`. The web scraper can be customized to extract specific information from the page, such as the title, description, and date. Moreover, the scraper can be set up to run automatically at specific intervals, allowing the user to gather data regularly without manual intervention ( setting up bots ).

## Usage
To use the web scraper, simply input the URL of the website you wish to scrape and press the `"Extract"` button. The web scraper will then extract all the `links` on the page and store the results in a CSV file on your local system with the same name as the domain of the website.

You can also customize the web scraper to extract specific information from the page by modifying the code in the `WebScraper.java` file.

## Applications
The web scraper using Java is a useful tool for anyone who needs to collect data from websites, such as market researchers, data scientists, and journalists. The data collected can be used for a variety of purposes, including trend analysis, market research, and content creation.
Furthermore it can be used in `CyberSecurity` applications where it can be used to find `EndPoints` of any site to spot out vulnerabilities .

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the web scraper using Java is a powerful tool that can save time and effort by automating the data collection process. With its versatility and ease of use, it is a must-have tool for anyone in need of large amounts of data from websites.
